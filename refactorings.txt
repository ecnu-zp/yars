1.
	restaurant.php -> restaurant1.php
	
	Add the function:
		function getInput() {
			$input = trim(fgets(STDIN));
				echo "\n\n";
			return $input;
		}
	so all the lines
		$choice = trim(fgets($stdin));
		echo "\n\n";
	could be changed to the much more clear
		$choice = getInput();
	
	See lines 97, 107, 162 of restaurant.php, and lines 93, 108, 162 of
	restaurant1.php for relevent for relevent.

2.
	restaurant1.php -> restaurant2.php
	
	Add the function
		function printBill($myOrder, &$myWaiter, &$hasPaid, &$choice) {
			...
		}
	so that the condition of the inner loop 
		} else if ($choice == count($menu) + 1) {
			if (count($myOrder) == 0) {
				echo "You have no items to pay for!\n\n";
				continue;
			}

			// If the user has paid, don't let them pay again.
			if ($hasPaid) {
				echo "You've already paid!\n\n";
				continue;
			}

			// Subtotal variable
			$subtotal = 0;

			// View and possibly pay for bill.
			echo "Your bill:\n\n";
			echo "---\n";
			foreach ($myOrder as $item) {
				echo "\t " . $item . "\n";
				$subtotal += $item->getPrice();
			}

			// Final amount owed after tax
			$total = applyTax($subtotal);

			echo "---\n";
			echo "Subtotal:\t $".number_format($subtotal, 2).
			"\n";
			echo "Total:\t\t $".number_format($total, 2).
			"\n\n";
			echo "Your waiter: " . $myWaiter->getName() . "\n";

			// Option to pay.
			echo "If you'd like to pay now, enter a positive".
			" amount of money.\n?: ";
			$amount = getInput();
			if ($amount <= 0) {
				echo "Make sure you pay before".
				" you leave!\n\n";
			} else if ($amount < $total) {
				echo "You have not entered a large".
				" enough value!\n\n";
			} else { // if amount >= total
				echo "You gave a $".
				number_format($amount - $total, 2)
				." tip!  Thanks for your business!\n\n";
				$myWaiter->addToTip($amount - $total);
				$hasPaid = true;
				$choice = 0;
			}
		} else {
		...
	can be simplified to
		...
		} else if ($choice == count($menu) + 1) {
			printBill($myOrder, $myWaiter, $hasPaid, $choice);
		} else {
		...
	so that the inner loop code is easier to understand in one pass.  See
	line 127 of restaurant1.php and lines 65, 180 of restaurant2.php.
